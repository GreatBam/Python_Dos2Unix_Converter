# Python_Dos2Unix_Converter

Tool to convert files from Windows '\r\n' to Unix '\n' end lines

I make this tool cause I offten have conflict while deploying docker containers.

## Installation

Simply clone the repo or copy the main.py file content on your machine.

## Usage

Run the python script where you'll need it, it will ask you for the folder to convert path.

After entering the path, the script will apply changes to all subfiles.

Here you go, your docker deployment should succeed now !
